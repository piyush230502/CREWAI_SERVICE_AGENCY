# Quickstart & Deployment

## Local Development

1. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Flask app (development mode):**

   ```powershell
   $env:FLASK_APP = "app.py"
   $env:FLASK_ENV = "development"
   python app.py
   ```

   - Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

## Production Deployment (Windows)

1. **Install Gunicorn (for WSGI):**

   ```powershell
   pip install gunicorn
   ```

2. **Run Gunicorn:**

   ```powershell
   gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 4
   ```

   - The app will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

3. **(Optional) Use Nginx as a reverse proxy**
   - See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for a sample Nginx config.

## Docker Deployment

1. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```powershell
   docker build -t crewai-agency .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**

   ```powershell
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 crewai-agency
   ```

   - Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Environment Variables
- The Groq API key is provided via the frontend form for each request.
- For persistent keys, set `GROQ_API_KEY` in your environment or use a `.env` file (with `python-dotenv`).

## Notes
- For production, always use HTTPS (see Nginx + Let's Encrypt).
- Never commit your API keys.
- For scaling, use a process manager (systemd, supervisor, etc.) for Gunicorn.

# AI Services Agency üë®‚Äçüíº

An AI application that simulates a full-service digital agency using multiple AI agents to analyze and plan software projects. Each agent represents a different role in the project lifecycle, from strategic planning to technical implementation.

## Demo:

## Features

### Five specialized AI agents 

- **CEO Agent**: Strategic leader and final decision maker
  - Analyzes startup ideas using structured evaluation
  - Makes strategic decisions across product, technical, marketing, and financial domains
  - Uses AnalyzeStartupTool and MakeStrategicDecision tools

- **CTO Agent**: Technical architecture and feasibility expert
  - Evaluates technical requirements and feasibility
  - Provides architecture decisions
  - Uses QueryTechnicalRequirements and EvaluateTechnicalFeasibility tools

- **Product Manager Agent**: Product strategy specialist
  - Defines product strategy and roadmap
  - Coordinates between technical and marketing teams
  - Focuses on product-market fit

- **Developer Agent**: Technical implementation expert
  - Provides detailed technical implementation guidance

- **Technical Tools**: CreateTechnicalSpecification for technical assessment

### üîÑ Asynchronous Communication

The agency operates in async mode, enabling:
- Parallel processing of analyses from different agents
- Efficient multi-agent collaboration
- Real-time communication between agents
- Non-blocking operations for better performance

### üîó Agent Communication Flows
- CEO ‚ÜîÔ∏è All Agents (Strategic Oversight)
